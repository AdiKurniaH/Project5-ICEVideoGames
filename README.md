# ICE Project
ICE is a online store selling video games from all over the world. Data related to user and expert game reviews, genre, platform (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data are available from open sources. Data needs to identify patterns that determine whether a game can be said to be successful or not. That way, we can find the games with the most potential and plan their advertising campaigns. For related data, the data used is data from 2016.

## Objective
From the available data, let's make an analysis of a game that can be said to be successful or not and predict which games have great potential in the coming years. From the data that has been analyzed, we can create a kind of advertising campaign plan for the game that is said to be successful.

## There are several stages in analyzing this data:
1. Import Library
2. Data exploration
3. Data pre-processing
4. Data Analysis
5. User Profiling by Region
6. Hypothesis Testing
7. General Conclusion
